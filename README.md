Student Performance Prediction
Overview
This project analyzes student performance data and builds a predictive model using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to students' demographics, family background, study habits, and academic performance. The goal is to predict students' final grades (G3) based on these features using a neural network implemented in TensorFlow.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 397 student records with the following features:

age: Student's age (15-22)
Medu: Mother's education level (0-4)
Fedu: Father's education level (0-4)
traveltime: Travel time to school (1-4)
studytime: Weekly study time (1-4)
failures: Number of past class failures (0-3)
famrel: Quality of family relationships (1-5)
freetime: Free time after school (1-5)
goout: Going out with friends (1-5)
Dalc: Workday alcohol consumption (1-5)
Walc: Weekend alcohol consumption (1-5)
health: Current health status (1-5)
absences: Number of school absences (0-75)
G1: First period grade (0-20)
G2: Second period grade (0-20)
G3: Final grade (0-20, target variable)
A summary of the dataset is provided in the Jupyter Notebook (student_performance.ipynb).

Visualize predictions vs. actual values.
Model Details
The project uses a TensorFlow Sequential model to predict the final grade (G3). Key steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Features are extracted from the dataset, and the data is split into training (X_train, y_train) and test sets.
Model Architecture: A simple neural network (specific layers not fully defined in the provided code snippet).
Training: The model is trained for 100 epochs with mean squared error as the loss function.
Evaluation: Training loss is computed, and predictions are visualized using custom plotting functions.
Known Issues
The provided code snippet encounters a ValueError: Failed to convert a NumPy array to a Tensor (Unsupported object type int) during model training. This is likely due to incompatible data types in X_train or y_train. Ensure all input data is converted to appropriate numeric types (e.g., float32) before training:
python

Wrap

Copy
X_train = X_train.astype('float32')
y_train = y_train.astype('float32')
Visualization
The notebook includes a custom function disp12 to visualize model predictions against actual values. It:

Splits the data into segments (controlled by the split_ parameter).
Plots predicted and actual grades for a specified segment using Matplotlib scatter plots.
Example output:

Predictions and actual values are plotted on the same graph for comparison.
False predictions are counted and displayed.
Future Improvements
Fix the ValueError by ensuring proper data type conversion.
Add model architecture details (e.g., number of layers, neurons, activation functions).
Evaluate the model on a test set (X_test, y_test) and report metrics like MSE or R².
Incorporate hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, epochs).
Enhance visualization with additional metrics or plots (e.g., loss curves).
